The **Spotify Cover Generator** is a website created so that users can create their own official-looking Spotify covers. Featuring many types of covers such as a regular cover, "This Is" covers, and even Top 50 covers.

## Use
To use the Spotify Cover Generator, all you have to do is go to [the site](https://www.roc0ast3r.dev/spotify) and you'll find all of your options. Select a type, and enter in the below fields. After you are done selecting and typing out all (or most) of the fields, scroll all the way down and click the button that says *Download*. Upon clicking it, give it a second or two as it is now processing your cover.

After the processing is done, an alert should pop up notifying you that your cover is ready. Scroll down a little bit, and you will see your generated cover. To download it, right click on the image and click *Save image as*.

> ***NOTE:** Make sure to save the file as a .jpg/.jpeg, or else the cover will not work on Spotify!*
